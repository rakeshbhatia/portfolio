                <p>Once I had gotten my feet wet with data scraping for NBA statistics, I decided to apply
                  these techniques towards other applications as well. Another field that has picqued my
                  interest in recent years has been finance and stock market investing. In fact, at one
                  point during college I was hell-bent on becoming an investment banker (however, after
                  hearing some horror stories, I'm kind of glad that didn't work out for me). Anyhow, as
                  a typical small investor who only dabbles in stocks once in a while, I wanted to collect
                  information that wasn't always readily available online in the form that I wanted to see it.</p>

                <p>As an initial exercise, I wanted to generate a list of all dividend stocks in the three major
                  indexes - Nasdaq, Standard and Poor's 500, and the Dow 30. The problem with most stock market
                  websites is that there always seems to be some necessary information missing from a stock quote. I've
                  used Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch, CNBC, CNN Money, The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily,
                  and Bloomberg, among others, and there was always something lacking or difficult to find in terms
                  of filtering out a subset of stocks that fit a certain criteria. In this case, I wanted a list of
                  all the top dividend stocks, along with their market cap and 52-week change.</p>

                  At first, Yahoo! Finance turned out to be the best resource for me, because it contained two out of
                  the above three pieces of information, the dividend yield and market cap. However, the 52-week % Change
                  was stored on a separate page, the "Statistics" page for that particular stock quote. This wouldn't have
                  been a problem, except for the fact that the "Statistics" page data was rendered in javascript as opposed
                  to html. This would require the use of a heavyweight library such as Splinter or Selenium, so after some
                  more searching, I found another resource that was rendered in pure html. This resource was Barron's.
                  Javascript web scraping is still an important topic, however, and something that I will cover in a later
                  post.</p>
                <!-- <p>This project also serves as an exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP). Initially, when I created a rough
                  first iteration for this project, I did it in a non-object-oriented manner. However, translating my code from
                  a rough script into a more structured, object-oriented program served as an excellent exercise in the power of
                  OOP.</p> -->
                <p>I realized that I would have to obtain information separately for each of the major indexes that I was
                  interested in. Thus, I created a common base class called Index which would collect information on all stocks
                  in a particular index, and create a list of Stock objects for all the companies that the Index contained. I will
                  go over the Stock class definition in a bit.</p>

                <p>Below is the first part of my <font face="Inconsolata, Monaco, Consolas, 'Courier New', Courier">Index</font> class
                  definition, showing the constructor.</p>
                <pre class="brush: python">
                  class Index:
                      'Common base class for all indexes'
                      index_count = 0

                      def __init__(self, name, index_file=None, index_link=None):
                          self.name = name
                          self.index_file = index_file
                          self.index_link = index_link
                          self.index_dict = {}
                          self.stock_list = []
                          self.stock_data = []
                          self.out_file = '../docs/' + name.lower() + '-dividend-stocks-sorted.csv'
                          Index.index_count += 1
                </pre>
                <p>Notice that the index_file and index_link variables are optional. This is because I obtain the Nasdaq stock list from a
                  CSV file that is downloaded off Nasdaq's web site, whereas I obtain the stock lists for both the S&P 500 and the Dow from
                  Wikipedia. The create_dict() member function, shown below, handles the three separate mechanisms for generating stocks
                  associated with the indexes above. Essentially, a new dictionary called index_dict is created, with the company's ticker
                  symbol and company name forming the key-value pair stored in the dictionary.</p>
                <p>Let's move on to the create_dict() member function belonging to Index. </p>

                </pre>
                <p>Lines 2-7 above handle the opening of the CSV file that stores a list of all Nasdaq dividend stocks. However, one thing
                to keep in mind is that there are also ETFs and other funds associated with a particular index; I am not interested in
                obtaining data for these, only for actual companies. This is why I have the if statement in line 6 - it helps filter out
                some, but not all, of these unwanted funds from the CSV file. Additional filtering will be done in a later step.</p>
                <p>Lines 8-24 and 25-42 are essentially the same mechanisms, but for the S&P and Dow, respectively. The urllib2.urlopen()
                function from the BeautifulSoup library is used to load the Wikipedia html page that stores the list of index components.
                Then, this page is given as an argument to the BeautifulSoup constructor in order to create a self.soup object, which stores
                the pure text from the html on that page.</p>
                <p>Once the BeautifulSoup object is created, I use the self.soup.findAll() function to obtain all the text corresponding to
                a specific tag. This requires inspection of the html source code (right click anywhere on page -> view source). Inspection of
                the html for the Wikipedia page revealed that the company names for the index were stored within a table corresponding to the
                'wikitable-sortable' class. However, two additional inner loops are required to extract the text within the tr (tablerow) and
                td (tabledata) elements within this table. The tr element stores all the information displayed for one particular stock, while
                the 1st and 3rd td elements within a tr element store the company name and ticker symbol, respectively. This is why the loop is
                calibrated the way that it is, with the count variable being reset after reaching 3.</p>
                <p>Once I obtain these two pieces of text, I store them into self.index_dict, with the ticker symbol as the key value corresponding
                to a particular company name. Once our Index object's dictionary is fully populated, the next step is to add stocks to the Index's
                stock list. However, in order to add a stock to the list, we first have to define a type of Stock object that stores the data which
                we are after. The Stock class definition is shown below:</p>

                </pre>
                <p>We see that the constructor takes two required arguments, symbol and company (which, if you recall, we are deriving
                  from Index's member function create_dict()). Additionally, self.data is being initialized to an empty list. The
                  query_stock_symbol() method handles the extraction of data from the particular stock quote page on barrons.com. I use
                  this method to collect several key pieces of information, including the market cap, 52-week % change, and dividend
                  yield. Now that our stock class is fully defined, we can jump back to finishing up the Index class. We will need a
                  member function to add stocks to the Index object's stock list. The Index.add_stocks() function is shown below: </p>
                <pre class="brush: python">
                  def add_stocks(self):
                      for key, value in self.index_dict.items():
                          new_stock = Stock(key, value)
                          new_stock.query_stock_symbol()
                          if new_stock.div_yield != None:
                              self.stock_list.append(new_stock)
                      #Sort the stock list by yield amount, in desecending order
                      self.stock_list.sort(key=lambda stock: stock.div_yield, reverse=True)
                </pre>
                <p>Essentially, I create a new Stock object and then use its query_stock_symbol method to extract its data. Remember that
                  we are only interested in dividend stocks - this is why I added an extra if condition to check whether the value of
                  div_yield exists or not. Once I have finished populating the stock list, I sort the list in descending order using
                  Python's sort() feature. I used a simple lambda function as my key value argument for the sort() method (not to be
                  confused with a dictionary key). The lambda function evaluates to the value of the stock's div_yield member variable.</p>
                <p>Great - we're almost done! However, we still need to output the data to a CSV file so that we can actually visualize it.
                  This task is handled in the from_dict_to_csv() function, shown below.</p>

                <p>Nothing too fancy here, just a straightforward iteration through the stock list and utilizing python's csv module to write
                  the data to an output file. The remainder of my overall program, stock_data.py, is shown below. Everything is encapsulated
                  underneath the global function generate_dividend_stocks().</p>

                <p>Of course, you could extend the OOP functionality even further, possibly creating a StockMarket object that stores multiple indexes,
                  but I strayed away from doing this initially just for simplicity. That's it for this tutorial! In my next post, I will discuss what we
                  can do with this data, now that we have collected it all in one place, as well as further knobs/tweaks we can add to the program above.
